# cal-DEFxzsidesanyYHIwall
Interactive program to approximate the xz deformation distance (at any wall hi) so as to match the density of a bulk system (no walls). Independant on the bond length, only scaling is applied to reach at a better prediction.

Example:
Three simulation runs are mandatory to match the density of a bulk system (no walls): First run is an equilibrum run, with yhi = 20; second being a run with yhi = 20 and deforming x and z.Third run is with similar settings as the latter, and makes the approximation better. Scaling is independant of most material characterestics, so I guess its safe to work with this code at any chain length.

No changes to repo name expected
